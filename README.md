# snake
This is my implementation of the classic game snake using Javascript.  This was designed to work on an AWS EC2 instance Apache server.  
For functionality of the login, users, and highscores you must install MongoDB on the server.
However, the game can still function by just downloading the repository and opening snake.html in your browser.
